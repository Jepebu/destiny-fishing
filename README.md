Another simple video game automation

Destiny 2 Season of the Deep introduced fishing! Another time consuming, repetetive task.

Well, here it is automated. Set it up, run from command prompt, hold backspace to kill the process.

Enjoy your loot!

(Made to run on 1920x1080 screens with Destiny 2 running on the main monitor.)
